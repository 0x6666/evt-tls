# EVT
Evt is an abstraction layer of OpenSSL using Bio pair to expose callback based asynchronous API and should integrate easily with any event based networking library like libuv, libevent and libev. This is primarily developed for libuv-tls.

The Evt will evaluate and try to support other TLS library like libtls, mbedtls etc.

This is still work in progress.
